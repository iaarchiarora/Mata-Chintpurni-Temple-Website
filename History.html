<h1 class="txtefct"> HISTORY AND MYTHOLOGY OF MATA CHINTPURNI</h1>
</center>
<p class="intro">
 This is the old Temple of Mata Bhagwati Chinnamasta Devi. According to one of the sacred books of Sanatam Dharm, Shri Markandeye Puran, after killing of all the Asuras and upon victory in the big war, Maa Bhagwati's 2 'sahyoginis', Jaya and Vijaya who had killed the various Asuras and drank their blood, were still thirst for more blood. So Maa cut her own head and quenched the thirst of her sahyoginis with her own blood. Since then, Maa Bhagwati's this roop was called as Maa Chinnamastika or Mata Chinnamasta (Chinna is without and Masta is Head).

As per old Granths, Puranas and other Dharmic Books, it is also mentioned that Maa Chhinnamastika's Dham or place or temple will be guarded by Lord Rudra Mahadev all sides. Hence this place has a perfect reasoning to be that Dham/ Temple. It has Mahadev's temple on all 4 sides as

    East- Kaleshwar Mahadev Temple
    West- Narahna Mahadev Temple
    North- Muchhkund Mahadev Temple
    South- Shiv Bari Temple


Hence this temple was declared as Maa Chinnamastika Devi Dham or Mata Chinnamasta Temple.

Further, Pandit Mai Das was a famous devotee of Maa Chinnamasta and worshipped Her till one day She gave him Her Darshan. The place was though called Chhabroh, however since Maa came and relieved Pandait Mai Das from all his tensions, this place got more popular by the name Chintpurni.
